**MISSION STATEMENT**

PRIME-TR aims to position MD Anderson as a pioneer in transforming cancer therapy through the modulation of the human microbiome.

The human microbiome—the diverse collection of microbes inhabiting our bodies—profoundly influences cancer development, progression, and treatment response through mechanisms that remain incompletely understood. Environmental factors such as diet and therapeutic interventions can significantly alter the microbiome, creating downstream effects on immune function and disease outcomes.

At PRIME-TR, we believe that deciphering the complex interplay between microbiome, host, and environment represents a critical frontier in advancing cancer care. This understanding demands a sophisticated, multidisciplinary research approach.

Our mission is to build a robust translational research framework that:

- Leverages existing institutional resources and expertise
- Develops strategic programs and collaborations
- Supports high-impact microbiome profiling studies
- Designs innovative interventional clinical trials

Through this concerted effort, we aim to transform cancer management by incorporating microbiome science into improved prevention strategies, more accurate diagnostic tools, and more effective, personalized treatment approaches for both cancer patients and at-risk populations.
